  <h1>BEST PLACES I HAVE BEEN TO</h1>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Well to say the truth, I have not been to many places around the world. Some places that I have been to do not show their beauty by their complex architecture or beautiful beaches,but rather they show their beauty by their people's culture and heritage.  The diversity I have seen in my lifetime is enough to prove that we as a human race should accept each other and love each other, rather than judge each other.</p>
  <p>So, here are some of my favorite places to visit</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Rwanda</strong></li>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rwanda&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQzJ266IbUAhVBsxQKHe-RAeoQ_AUICCgD&biw=917&bih=970#tbm=isch&q=rwanda+today&imgrc=gzafYRzeunq78M">Landscape</a>
      <p>Well Rwanda is one of those countries not famed by its complex designs and natural beauty, rather it is known for its peoples' struggle. This is what stood out to me. The country itself is beautiful nonetheless but the people's efforts to rise up from the genocide are what struck me most</p>
    <li><strong>The Amazon</strong></li>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=amazon&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCt6Tm6YbUAhWECcAKHQaxAZEQ_AUIDCgD&biw=917&bih=970#tbm=isch&q=amazon+rainforest&imgrc=6eX6ukfR7AO5jM:">Amazon</a>
      <p>The Amazon is home to many species of different animals. Furthermore, the people who live there do not live in a modern way. They still practise hunting and gathering, and worship different gods. They even get their medicine from the jungle's leaves and flowers. This was quite intersting to me</p>
    <li><strong>London</strong></li>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=london&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjU3-Ge6obUAhViLsAKHcffD40Q_AUIDCgD&biw=917&bih=970#imgrc=Ite3KXZfWt64fM:">London bridge</a>
      <p>Well my list couldn't quite be complete without London. A city full of beautiful structures all around and an experience there was unforgettable</p>
